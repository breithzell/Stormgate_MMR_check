# Stormgate MMR check
This project is extracting the data from stormgate.untapped.gg to show the difference in MMR between two players during every available game. This code has been written for the sole purpose to have objective data to discuss about the match making system and what may, or may not happen if we extend the matching time to get an opponent with a closer MMR.

The available plot and data have been collected on the 14/11/2024.
